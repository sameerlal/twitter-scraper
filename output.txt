Watching you guys sing that once more I was so blessed. I really felt that performance down to my soul... it was a spiritual experience @jlloydharmon @CynthiaErivo  #AmericanIdol

We hope you apply the advice we give you and come back and show us we were wrong!  #americanidol
We appreciate you guys taking bad news with such grace @claypagemusic @KasonLester @Johannalynjones. I know I’ve said it before but we really are so proud of these contestants for their growth and putting themselves out there.
Your resilience has been so inspiring not just to us, but to countless others @NickTownsend40. Keep singing my angel  #americanidol
That @LaciKayeBooth really is something special  #americanidol
Watching it again I guess it was more like a chair nudge than a chair toss  #americanidol
It’s been incredible to see @Kaithesinger1 go from a ball of nerves at her audition, to doing those moves on stage in front of that crowd  Keep growing, and taking those steps! #americanidol
I say it all the time: You can’t skip the steps... #americanidol
It was amazing watching you grow on this journey @DrakeMcCain1. Take that with you into your next chapter.  Also, I’mma miss your hair TBH  #americanidol
